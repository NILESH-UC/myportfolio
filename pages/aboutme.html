    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Nilesh Bhardwaj, an 18-year-old from Rajasthan with a passion for technology and development. I completed my schooling at Shivaji School (7th to 10th grade) and Maharana Pratap School (10th to 12th grade). Currently, I'm pursuing my Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) at Mewar University, Chittorgarh.</p>
    <p>In addition to my studies, I'm also enhancing my skills through a Python Full-Stack Development course in Ahmedabad. My areas of interest include Python programming, web development, and exploring the endless possibilities in the tech world.</p>
    <p>When I'm not coding, you'll find me playing cricket or indulging in video games like Free Fire and PUBG. My love for technology and sports keeps me balanced and motivated to achieve my goals. I was born on March 7, 2006, and this portfolio is a step towards showcasing my skills and experiences.</p>
